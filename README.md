# TO-DO LIST APP

This app uses local storage of the browser to store the daily task that one person will be performing at his/her job. This app then displays the list of the tasks that are pending. After completing the task, you can simply click 'Done' to remove the pending task from the To-do list.

# Technologies Used

This app is created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript without any library or JS framework, using classes, local storage, and much more.

All the classes are located in the app.js file

# Why I build this App

I build this app for mostly my use and also to sharpen my skills in Vanilla JavaScript before jumping into any frameworks,
